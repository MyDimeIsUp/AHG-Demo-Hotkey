# AHG Demo Hotkey

## Info
A simple hotkey program that allows you to set a specified hotkey, minimize the program to your system tray, and press said hotkey while in Garry's Mod to automatically start recording a demo. This program will automatically create a directory for the demo to be stored in based off of the date.

## Where can I find my demos?
Go to your Garry's Mod directory, then go to `demos/ahg`. Once in that folder, you can enter each directory in the following order `{year}/{month}/{day}/{hour}`. Each demo file name is in `{Hour}-{Minute}-{Second}.dem` format.
